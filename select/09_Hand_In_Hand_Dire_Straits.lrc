[00:19.02] The sky is crying, the streets are full of tears
[00:24.48] Rain come down, wash away my fears
[00:27.31] And all this writing on the wall
[00:30.65] Oh, I can read between the lines
[00:46.65] 
[00:37.59] Rain come down, forgive this dirty town
[00:42.14] Rain come down, and give this dirty town
[00:45.99] A drink of water, a drink of wine
[01:02.49] 
[00:54.66] If I been hard on you, I never chose to be
[01:00.16] I never wanted no one else
[01:04.51] I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
[01:08.89] Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to
[01:28.89] 
[01:14.48] As you'd sleep, I'd think my heart would break in two
[01:19.40] I'd kiss your cheek, I'd stop myself from waking you
[01:23.61] But in the dark you'd speak my name
[01:26.61] You'd say, "Baby what's wrong?"
[01:42.11] 
[01:32.82] Oh, here I am baby, I'm coming back for more
[01:36.60] I'm like a wave that's got to roll into the shore
[01:41.97] Yes, and if my love's in vain, how come my love is so strong?
[02:12.47] 
[01:50.22] If I been hard on you, I never chose to be
[01:55.74] I never wanted no one else
[02:00.25] And I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
[02:04.70] Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to
[02:10.22] Supposed to be
[02:17.22] 
[02:42.94] Now you and me go parallel together and apart
[02:47.11] And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart
[02:51.74] Did you never feel the distance
[02:54.13] You never tried to cross no line
[03:10.13] 
[03:00.18] 'Cause it's another dirty river and another dirty scar
[03:05.21] And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are
[03:09.04] So far from home, don't you think of me some time
[03:33.54] 
[03:18.33] If I been hard on you, I never chose to be
[03:23.33] I never wanted no one else
[03:28.02] I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
[03:52.04] Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to
[04:12.04] 
[04:16.38] Well, sky is crying, see the streets are full of tears
[04:21.91] Rain come down, wash away my fears
[04:26.48] And all this writing on the wall
[04:29.89] Oh, I can read between the lines
